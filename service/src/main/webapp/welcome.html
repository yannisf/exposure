<h3>Welcome to Perfect exposure!</h3>

<p>
    Perfect exposure is a web application that provides tools to help you achieve the elusive perfect exposure.
    Currently, it consists of three modules.
</p>

<h4>Equivalent</h4>
<p>
    The user selects an initial exposure, typically one the camera light meter suggests. Then alters one of
    the exposure parameters and the application compensates to achieve an equivalent exposure.
</p>

<h4>Filter</h4>
<p>
    The user selects an initial shutter speed, typically suggested by the camera. Then selects and stacks filters.
    The application provides the facility to compensate the filtering by adjusting the shutter speed.
</p>

<h4>DOF</h4>
<p>
    The user provides initial exposure parameters, such as sensor type, focal length and subject distance.
    The application calculates important focus parameters such as hyperfocal distance, near and far focus points.
